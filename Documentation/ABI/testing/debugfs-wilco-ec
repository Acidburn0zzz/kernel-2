		As part of Chrome OS's FAFT (Fully Automated Firmware Testing)
		tests, we need to ensure that the H1 chip is properly setting
		some GPIO lines. The h1_gpio attribute exposes the state

KernelVersion:	5.1
Description:
		Write and read raw mailbox commands to the EC.

		For writing:
		Bytes 0-1 indicate the message type:
			00 F0 = Execute Legacy Command
			00 F2 = Read/Write NVRAM Property
		Byte 2 provides the command code
		Bytes 3+ consist of the data passed in the request

		At least three bytes are required, for the msg type and command,
		with additional bytes optional for additional data.

		Example:
		// Request EC info type 3 (EC firmware build date)
		$ echo 00 f0 38 00 03 00 > raw
		// View the result. The decoded ASCII result "12/21/18" is
		// included after the raw hex.
		$ cat raw
		00 31 32 2f 32 31 2f 31 38 00 38 00 01 00 2f 00  .12/21/18.8...
